This repository contains QGIS training modules developed by Cefas in 2020/2021. The modules are standalone and they can be taken in any order. No previous knowledge of QGIS or GIS is required to complete these modules. 

The repository consists of the following modules:

Each module includes instructions in both PDF and markdwon format. There is also a link to a video which supplements the written instructions. To access the video and data, please contact us at gissupport@cefas.co.uk, stating the module name that you would like to get access to. We recommend accessing both the written instruction and the video in order to benefit from the learning experience these offer to their maximum.

You will need to download and install the latest vestion of "QGIS Standalone Installer" based on the requirements of your operation system (either 32 or 64 bit version).
