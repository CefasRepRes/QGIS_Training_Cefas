This repository contains QGIS training modules developed by Cefas in 2020/2021. The modules are standalone and they can be taken in any order. No previous knowledge of QGIS or GIS is required to complete these modules. 

The repository consists of the following modules:

* **Module 0 Introduction to GIS using QGIS**

* **Module 1 Map Creation and Visualisation**

* **Module 2 Data Symbology and Querying**

* **Module 3 Digitisation**

* **Module 4 Coordinate Reference Systems**

* **Module 5 Raster in QGIS**


Each module includes instructions in both PDF and markdown format. There is also a video which supplements the written instructions and provides a demonstration. To access the video and data, please contact us at gissupport@cefas.co.uk, stating the module name that you would like to get access to. We recommend accessing both the written instruction and the video in order to benefit from the learning experience these offer to their maximum. 

Before you start any of the modules, please install the QGIS Desktop application from this [link](https://qgis.org/en/site/index.html). You will need to download and install the latest version of "QGIS Standalone Installer" based on the requirements of your operation system (either 32 or 64 bit version). If you are a Cefas staff, you can installl QGIS from the Software Centre.  More information on how to install QGIS can be found in Module 0.
